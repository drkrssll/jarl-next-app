This is a Next.js app, so it's pretty simple to get it up and running.

First you'll need to make a github account. This is pretty self explanatory, so I won't go into it here.

Github accounts allow you to remain anonymous, so you can use a fake name and what not.

Once you have a github account, you need to fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository in your own account.

Here is the Github link:
https://github.com/drkrssll/jarl-next-app

The fork button will be near the top right of the page.

Once you have forked the repository, let me know so I can make the original repository private again.

Then, you can follow this short youtube video to get the app up and running on Vercel:

The command used at 30 seconds in the video is:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

THIS IS IMPORTANT. If you don't use the --legacy-peer-deps flag, the build will fail.
